# NYC Taxi Analysis using PySpark

## Project Overview
This project performs scalable big data analysis on the New York City Taxi Trip Records Dataset using PySpark. The objective is to process large volumes of taxi trip data efficiently and extract meaningful insights related to travel patterns, fare trends, and customer behavior.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.10
- PySpark 3.5.1
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda Navigator
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
- **Name:** New York City Taxi Trip Records Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Format:** Multiple CSV files  
- **Description:** Contains taxi trip information such as pickup and drop-off times, trip distance, fare amount, passenger count, and payment type.

## Project Workflow
1. Environment setup using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook  
2. Configuration of PySpark and SparkSession  
3. Loading multiple CSV files into PySpark DataFrames  
4. Data cleaning and transformation using PySpark  
5. Big data analysis and aggregation  
6. Visualization of insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn  

## Key Insights
- Identification of peak taxi demand hours  
- Analysis of average fare and trip distance  
- Passenger count and payment method distribution  
- Understanding travel patterns in NYC  

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook demonstrating PySpark-based analysis
- Extracted insights from large-scale data processing

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how PySpark can be effectively used for scalable data analytics on real-world datasets. The insights obtained can help in understanding urban transportation trends and support data-driven decision-making.
